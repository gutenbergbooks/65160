a modest ingenious person, &amp; a pretty Scholar,

an occasion of vindicating himself from
what I had heard of him; which truly he
did with so convincing Reason and circumstance,

of his Travels, which here you have
faithfully rendred out of Latine from his

<p class="dropcap">North, as well as South-<i>America</i>, may be divided
into three Regions: the Flats, the
Highlands, and the Mountains. The
Flats (in Indian, <i>Ahkynt</i>) is the Territory
lying between the Eastern Coast, and
the falls of the great Rivers, that there
run into the <i>Atlantick</i> Ocean, in extent generally taken
Ninety miles. The Highlands (in Indian, <i>Ahkontshuck</i>)
begin at those falls, and determine at the foot of the great
ridge of Mountains that runs thorow the midst of this Continent,
Northeast and Southwest, called by the Spaniards <i>Apalatæi</i>,
from the Nation <i>Apalakin</i>; and by the Indians, <i>Pæmotinck</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
According to the best of my observation and conjecture,
they lie parallel to the <i>Atlantick</i> Sea-coast, that
bearing from <i>Canada</i> to Cape <i>Florida</i>, Northeast and Southwest,
and then falling off due West as the Mountains do at
<i>Sara</i>: but here they take the name of <i>Suala</i>; <i>Sara</i> in the
<i>Warrennuncock</i> dialect being <i>Sasa</i> or <i>Sualy</i>.</p>

<p>The Flats, or <i>Ahkynt</i>, are by former Writers made so well
known to Christendom, that I will not stop the Reader
here, with an unnecessary description of them; but shall
onely say, that by the rankness of the Soyl, and salt moistness
of the Air, daily discoveries of Fish-shells three fathom
deep in the earth, and Indian tradition; these parts are supposed
some Ages past to have lain under the Sea.</p>

<p>The Highlands (or <i>Ahkontshuch</i>) though under the same
Parallels, are happie notwithstanding in a more temperate
and healthful Air. The ground is over-grown with under-wood
in many places, and that so perplext and interwoven
with Vines, that who travels here, must sometimes cut
through his way. These Thickets harbour all sorts of beasts
of prey, as Wolves, Panthers, Leopards, Lions, <i>&amp;c.</i> (which
are neither so large nor so fierce as those of <i>Asia</i> and <i>Africa</i>)
and small Vermine, as wilde Cats, Foxes, Racoons. These
parts were formerly possessed by the <i>Tacci</i>, aliàs <i>Dogi</i>; but
they are extinct; and the Indians now seated here, are distinguished
into the several Nations of <i>Mahoe</i>, <i>Nuntaneuck</i>, aliàs
<i>Nuntaly</i>, <i>Nabyssan</i>, <i>Sapon</i>, <i>Managog</i>, <i>Mangoack</i>, <i>Akenatzy</i>,
and <i>Monakin</i>, &amp;c. One Language is common to them
all, though they differ in Dialects. The parts inhabited here
are pleasant and fruitful, because cleared of Wood, and laid
open to the Sun. The Valleys feed numerous herds of Deer
and Elks larger then Oxen: these Valleys they call <i>Savanæ</i>,
being Marish grounds at the foot of the <i>Apalatæi</i>, and yearly
laid under water in the beginning of Summer by flouds
of melted Snow falling down from the Mountains.</p>

<p>The <i>Apalatæan</i> Mountains, called in Indian <i>Pæmotinck</i>,
(or the origine of the Indians) are barren Rocks, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
therefore deserted by all living creatures but Bears, who cave
in the hollow Cliffs. Yet do these Mountains shoot out to
the Eastward great Promontories of rich Land, known by
the high and spreading trees which they bear: these Promontories,
because lower then the main Ridge, are called by
the Indians <i>Tanx-Pæmotinck</i> (aliàs <i>Aquatt</i>). To the Northeast
the Mountains rise higher; and at <i>Sara</i> they sink so
low, that they are easily passed over: but here (as was said
before) they change their course and name, running due
West, and being called <i>Sualy</i>: now the <i>Sualian</i> Mountains
rise higher and higher Westward.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Of the Manners and Customs of the <span class="antiqua">Indians</span>
inhabiting the Western parts of <span class="antiqua">Carolina</span>
and <span class="antiqua">Virginia</span>.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The Indians now seated in these parts, are none of those
which the English removed from <i>Virginia</i>, but a people
driven by an Enemy from the Northwest, and invited to
sit down here by an Oracle above four hundred years since,
as they pretend: for the ancient inhabitants of <i>Virginia</i>
were far more rude and barbarous, feeding onely upon raw
flesh and fish, until these taught them to plant Corn, and
shewed them the use of it.</p>

<p>But before I treat of their ancient Manners and Customs,
it is necessary I should shew by what means the knowledge
of them hath been conveyed from former ages to posterity.
Three ways they supply their want of Letters: first by
Counters, secondly by Emblems or Hieroglyphicks, thirdly
by Tradition delivered in long Tales from father to son,
which being children they are made to learn by rote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>For Counters, they use either Pebbles, or short scantlings
of straw or reeds. Where a Battel has been fought, or a
Colony seated, they raise a small Pyramid of these stones,
consisting of the number slain or transplanted. Their reeds
and straws serve them in Religious Ceremonies: for they
lay them orderly in a Circle when they prepare for Devotion
or Sacrifice; and that performed, the Circle remains
still, for it is Sacriledge to disturb or to touch it: the disposition
and sorting of the straws and reeds, shew what
kinde of Rites have there been celebrated, as Invocation, Sacrifice,
Burial, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The faculties of the minde and body they commonly express
by Emblems. By the figure of a Stag, they imply
swiftness; by that of a Serpent, wrath; of a Lion, courage;
of a Dog, fidelity: by a Swan, they signifie the <i>English</i>,
alluding to their complexion, and flight over the Sea.</p>

<p>An account of Time, and other things, they keep on a
string or leather thong tied in knots of several colours. I
took particular notice of small Wheels serving for this
purpose amongst the <i>Oenocks</i>, because I have heard that the
<i>Mexicans</i> use the same. Every Nation gives his particular
Ensigne or Arms: The <i>Sasquesahanaugh</i> a Tarapine, or small
Tortoise; the <i>Akenatzy’s</i> a Serpent; the <i>Nahyssanes</i> three
Arrows, <i>&amp;c.</i> In this they likewise agree with the <i>Mexican</i>
Indians. <i>Vid. Jos. à Costa.</i></p>

<p>They worship one God, Creator of all things, whom
some call <i>Okæè</i>, others <i>Mannith</i>: to him alone the High-priest,
or <i>Periku</i>, offers Sacrifice; and yet they believe he has
no regard to sublunary affairs, but commits the Government
of Mankinde to lesser Deities, as <i>Quiacosough</i> and <i>Tagkanysough</i>,
that is, good and evil Spirits: to these the inferiour
Priests pay their devotion and Sacrifice, at which they
make recitals, to a lamentable Tune, of the great things
done by their Ancestors.</p>

<p>From four women, <i>viz.</i> <i>Pash</i>, <i>Sepoy</i>, <i>Askarin</i>, and <i>Maraskarin</i>,
they derive the Race of Mankinde; which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
therefore divide into four Tribes, distinguished under those
several names. They very religiously observe the degrees of
Marriage, which they limit not to distance of Kindred, but
difference of Tribes, which are continued in the issue of the
Females: now for two of the same Tribe to match, is abhorred
as Incest, and punished with great severity.</p>

<p>Their places of Burial they divide into four quarters, assigning
to every Tribe one: for, to mingle their bodies, even
when dead, they hold wicked and ominous. They
commonly wrap up the corpse in beasts skins, and bury with
it Provision and Houshold stuff for its use in the other
world. When their great men die, they likewise slay prisoners
of War to attend them. They believe the transmigration
of souls: for the Angry they say is possest with the
spirit of a Serpent; the Bloudy, with that of a Wolf; the
Timorous, of a Deer; the Faithful, of a Dog, <i>&amp;c.</i> and
therefore they are figured by these Emblemes.</p>

<p><i>Elizium</i>, or the abode of their lesser Deities, they place
beyond the Mountains and Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>Though they want those means of improving Humane
Reason, which the use of Letters affords us; let us not
therefore conclude them wholly destitute of Learning and
Sciences: for by these little helps which they have found,
many of them advance their natural understandings to great
knowledge in Physick, Rhetorick, and Policie of Government:
for I have been present at several of their Consultations
and Debates, and to my admiration have heard some of
their Seniors deliver themselves with as much Judgement
and Eloquence as I should have expected from men of Civil
education and Literature.</p>

From the head of <i>Pemæoncock</i>, aliàs <i>York-River</i>
(due West) to the top of the <i>Apalatæan</i>
Mountains.</h2>

</div>

<p>Upon the ninth of <i>March 1669</i> (with three Indians
whose names were <i>Magtakunh</i>, <i>Hopottoguoh</i>, and
<i>Naunnugh</i>) I went out at the falls of <i>Pemæoncock</i>, aliàs
<i>York-River</i> in <i>Virginia</i>, from an Indian Village called <i>Shickehamany</i>,
and lay that night in the Woods, encountring nothing
remarkable, but a Rattle-snake of an extraordinary,
length and thickness, for I judged it two yards and a half or
better from head to tail, and as big about as a mans arm:
by the distention of her belly, we believed her full with
young; but having killed and opened her, found there a
small Squirrel whole; which caused in me a double wonder:
first, how a Reptile should catch so nimble a creature
as a Squirrel; and having caught it, how she could swallow
it entire. The Indians in resolving my doubts, plunged me
into a greater astonishment, when they told me that it was
usual in these Serpents, when they lie basking in the Sun, to
fetch down these Squirrels from the tops of trees, by fixing
their eye stedfastly upon them; the horrour of which strikes
such an affrightment into the little beast, that he has no
power to hinder himself from tumbling down into the jaws
of his enemy, who takes in all his sustenance without chewing,
his teeth serving him onely to offend withal. But I rather
believe what I have heard from others, that these Serpents
climb the trees, and surprise their prey in the nest.</p>

<p>The next day falling into Marish grounds between <i>Pemæoncock</i>
and the head of the River <i>Matapeneugh</i>, the heaviness
of the way obliged me to cross <i>Pemæoncock</i>, where its North<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
and South-branch (called <i>Ackmick</i>) joyn in one. In the
Peninsula made by these two branches, a great Indian King
called <i>Tottopottoma</i> was heretofore slain in Battel, fighting
for the Christians against the <i>Mahocks</i> and <i>Nahyssans</i>, from
whence it retains his name to this day. Travelling thorow
the Woods, a Doe seized by a wild Cat crossed our way; the
miserable creature being even spent and breathless with the
burden and cruelty of her rider, who having fastned on her
shoulder, left not sucking out her bloud until she sunk under
him: which one of the Indians perceiving, let flie a luckie
Arrow, which piercing him thorow the belly, made him quit
his prey already slain, and turn with a terrible grimas at us;
but his strength and spirits failing him, we escaped his revenge,
which had certainly ensued, were not his wound
mortal. This creature is something bigger then our English
Fox, of a reddish grey colour, and in figure every way
agreeing with an ordinary Cat; fierce, ravenous and cunning:
for finding the Deer (upon which they delight most
to prey) too swift for them, they watch upon branches of
trees, and as they walk or feed under, jump down upon
them. The Fur of the wilde Cat, though not very fine, is
yet esteemed for its vertue in taking away cold Aches and
Pains, being worn next to the body: their flesh, though
rank as a Dogs, is eaten by the Indians.</p>

<p>The eleventh and twelfth, I found the ways very uneven,
and cumbred with bushes.</p>

<p>The thirteenth, I reached the first Spring of <i>Pemæoncock</i>,
having crossed the River four times that day, by reason of
its many windings; but the water was so shallow, that it
hardly wet my horses pasterns. Here a little under the surface
of the earth, I found flat pieces of petrified matter, of
one side solid Stone, but on the other side Isinglas, which I easily
peeled off in flakes about four inches square: several of
these pieces, with a transparent Stone like Crystal that cut
Glass, and a white Marchasite that I purchased of the Indians,
I presented to Sir <i>Wiliam Berkley</i> Governour of <i>Virginia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>The fourteenth of <i>March</i>, from the top of an eminent
hill, I first descried the <i>Apalatæan</i> Mountains, bearing due
West to the place I stood upon: their distance from me was
so great, that I could hardly discern whether they were
Mountains or Clouds, until my Indian fellow travellers prostrating
themselves in Adoration, howled out after a barbarous
manner, <i>Okée pœze</i>, i. e. <i>God is nigh</i>.</p>

<p>The fifteenth of <i>March</i>, not far from this hill, passing over
the South-branch of <i>Rappahanock</i>-river, I was almost
swallowed in a Quicksand. Great herds of Red and Fallow
Deer I daily saw feeding; and on the hill-sides, Bears crashing
Mast like Swine. Small Leopards I have seen in the
Woods, but never any Lions, though their skins are much
worn by the Indians. The Wolves in these parts are so ravenous,
that I often in the night feared my horse would be
devoured by them, they would gather up and howl so close
round about him, though Tether’d to the same tree at
whose foot I my self and the Indians lay: but the Fires
which we made, I suppose, scared them from worrying us
all. Beaver and Otter I met with at every River that I passed;
and the Woods are full of Grey Foxes.</p>

<p>Thus I travelled all the sixteenth; and on the seventeenth
of <i>March</i> I reached the <i>Apalatæi</i>. The Air here is very
thick and chill; and the waters issuing from the Mountain-sides,
of a Blue colour, and Allumish taste.</p>

<p>The eighteenth of <i>March</i>, after I had in vain assayed to
ride up, I alighted, and left my horse with one of the Indians,
whilst with the other two I climbed up the Rocks,
which were so incumbred with bushes and brambles, that
the ascent proved very difficult: besides, the first precipice
was so steep, that if I lookt down, I was immediately taken
with a swimming in my head; though afterwards the way
was more easie. The height of this Mountain was very
extraordinary: for notwithstanding I set out with the first
appearance of light, it was late in the evening before I gained
the top, from whence the next morning I had a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
prospect of the <i>Atlantick</i>-Ocean washing the <i>Virginian</i>-shore;
but to the North and West, my sight was suddenly bounded
by Mountains higher than that I stood upon. Here did
I wander in Snow, for the most part, till the Four and
twentieth day of <i>March</i>, hoping to finde some passage
through the Mountains; but the coldness of the Air and
Earth together, seizing my Hands and Feet with numbness,
put me to a <i>ne plus ultra</i>; and therefore having found my
<i>Indian</i> at the foot of the Mountain with my Horse, I returned
back by the same way that I went.</p>

From the Falls of <i>Powhatan</i>, aliàs <i>James-River</i>,
in <i>Virginia</i>, to <i>Mahock</i> in the
<i>Apalatæan</i> Mountains.</h2>

</div>

<p>The twentieth of <i>May</i> 1670, one Major <i>Harris</i> and my
self, with twenty <i>Christian</i> Horse, and five <i>Indians</i>,
marched from the Falls of <i>James-River</i>, in <i>Virginia</i>, towards
the <i>Monakins</i>; and on the Two and twentieth
were welcomed by them with Volleys of Shot. Near this
Village we observed a Pyramid of stones piled up together,
which their Priests told us, was the Number of an <i>Indian</i>
Colony drawn out by Lot from a Neighbour-Countrey over-peopled,
and led hither by one <i>Monack</i>, from whom
they take the Name of <i>Monakin</i>. Here enquiring the way
to the Mountains, an ancient Man described with a staffe
two paths on the ground; one pointing to the <i>Mahocks</i>,
and the other to the <i>Nahyssans</i>; but my <i>English</i> Companions
slighting the <i>Indians</i> direction, shaped their course by
the Compass due West, and therefore it fell out with us, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
it does with those Land-Crabs, that crawling backwards in
a direct line, avoid not the Trees that stand in their way,
but climbing over their very tops, come down again on the
other side, and so after a days labour gain not above two
foot of ground. Thus we obstinately pursuing a due West
course, rode over steep and craggy Cliffs, which beat our
Horses quite off the hoof. In these Mountains we wandred
from the Twenty fifth of <i>May</i> till the Third of <i>June</i>,
finding very little sustenance for Man or Horse; for these
places are destitute both of Grain and Herbage.</p>

<p>The third of <i>June</i> we came to the South-branch of
<i>James</i>-River, which Major <i>Harris</i> observing to run Northward,
vainly imagined to be an Arm of the Lake of <i>Canada</i>;
and was so transported with this Fancy, that he
would have raised a Pillar to the Discovery, if the fear of
the <i>Mahock Indian</i>, and want of food, had permitted him
to stay. Here I moved to cross the River and march on; but
the rest of the Company were so weary of the enterprize,
that crying out, <i>One and All</i>, they had offered violence to
me, had I not been provided with a private Commission
from the Governour of <i>Virginia</i> to proceed, though the rest
of the company should abandon me; the sight of which
laid their fury.</p>

<p>The lesser Hills, or <i>Akontshuck</i>, are here unpassable, being
both steep and craggy: the Rocks seemed to me at a distance
to resemble Eggs set up an end.</p>

<p><i>James</i>-River is here as broad as it is about an hundred
mile lower at <i>Monakin</i>; the passage over is very dangerous,
by reason of the rapid Torrents made by Rocks and Shelves
forcing the water into narrow Chanels. From an observation
which we made of straws and rotten chuncks hanging
in the boughs of Trees on the Bank, and two and twenty
foot above water, we argued that the melted Snow falling
from the Mountains swelled the River to that height, the
Flood carrying down that rubbish which, upon the abatement
of the Inundation, remained in the Trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>The Air in these parts was so moist, that all our Biscuit
became mouldy and unfit to be eaten, so that some nicer
stomachs, who at our setting out laughed at my provision
of <i>Indian</i>-meal parched, would gladly now have shared with
me: but I being determined to go upon further Discoveries,
refused to part with any of that which was to be my most
necessary sustenance.</p>

from <span class="antiqua">Mahock</span>, Southward, into the Province
of <span class="antiqua">Carolina</span>.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The fifth of <i>June</i>, my Company and I parted good
friends, they back again, and I with one <i>Sasquesahanough-Indian</i>,
named <i>Jackzetavon</i>, only, in pursuit of my
first Enterprize, changing my course from West to Southwest
&amp; by South, to avoid the Mountains. Major <i>Harris</i>
at parting gave me a Gun, believing me a lost man, and given
up as a prey to <i>Indians</i> or savage Beasts; which made
him the bolder in <i>Virginia</i> to report strange things in his
own praise and my disparagement, presuming I would never
appear to disprove him. This, I suppose, and no other,
was the cause that he did with so much industry procure me
discredit and odium; but I have lost nothing by it, but
what I never studied to gain, which is Popular applause.</p>

<p>From the fifth, which was <i>Sunday</i>, until the ninth of
<i>June</i>, I travelled through difficult Ways, without seeing any
Town or <i>Indian</i>; and then I arrived at <i>Sapon</i>, a Village of
the <i>Nahyssans</i>, about an hundred miles distant from <i>Mahock</i>,
scituate upon a branch of <i>Shawan</i>, aliàs <i>Rorenock</i>-River;
and though I had just cause to fear these <i>Indians</i>, because
they had been in continual Hostility with the <i>Christians</i> for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
ten years before; yet presuming that the Truck which I
carried with me would procure my welcome, I adventured
to put my self into their power, having heard that they
never offer any injury to a few persons from whom they apprehend
no danger: nevertheless, they examined me strictly
whence I came, whither I went, and what my business
was. But after I had bestowed some trifles of Glass and
Metal amongst them, they were satisfied with reasonable
answers, and I received with all imaginable demonstrations
of kindness, as offering of Sacrifice, a complement shewed
only to such as they design particularly to honour: but they
went further, and consulted their Godds whether they
should not admit me into their Nation and Councils, and
oblige me to stay amongst them by a Marriage with the
Kings or some of their great Mens Daughters. But I,
though with much a-do, waved their courtesie, and got my
Pastport, having given my word to return to them within
six months.</p>

<p><i>Sapon</i> is within the limits of the Province of <i>Carolina</i>,
and as you may perceive by the Figure, has all the attributes
requisite to a pleasant and advantagious Seat; for though it
stands high, and upon a dry land, it enjoyes the benefit of
a stately River, and a rich Soyl, capable of producing many
Commodities, which may hereafter render the Trade of it
considerable.</p>

<p>Not far distant from hence, as I understood from the
<i>Nahyssan</i> Indians, is their Kings Residence, called <i>Pintahæ</i>,
upon the same River, and happy in the same advantages
both for pleasure and profit: which my curiosity would
have led me to see, were I not bound, both by Oath and
Commission, to a direct pursuance of my intended purpose
of discovering a passage to the further side of the Mountains.</p>

<p>This Nation is governed by an absolute Monarch; the
People of a high stature, warlike and rich. I saw great store<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
of Pearl unbored in their little Temples, or Oratories, which
they had won amongst other spoyls from the Indians of
<i>Florida</i>, and hold in as great esteem as we do.</p>

<p>From hence, by the Indians instructions, I directed my
course to <i>Akenatzy</i>, an Island bearing South &amp; by West,
and about fifty miles distant, upon a branch of the same River,
from <i>Sapon</i>. The Countrey here, though high, is level,
and for the most part a rich soyl, as I judged by the
growth of the Trees; yet where it is inhabited by Indians,
it lies open in spacious Plains, and is blessed with a very
healthful Air, as appears by the age and vigour of the people;
and though I travelled in the month of <i>June</i>, the heat
of the weather hindred me not from Riding at all hours
without any great annoyance from the Sun. By easie journeys
I landed at <i>Akenatzy</i> upon the twelfth of <i>June</i>. The
current of the River is here so strong, that my Horse had
much difficulty to resist it; and I expected every step to be
carried away with the stream.</p>

<p>This Island, though small, maintains many inhabitants,
who are fix’d here in great security, being naturally fortified
with Fastnesses of Mountains, and Water of every side. Upon
the North-shore they yearly reap great crops of Corn, of
which they always have a twelve-months Provision afore-hand,
against an Invasion from their powerful Neighbours.
Their Government is under two Kings, one presiding
in Arms, the other in Hunting and Husbandry. They hold
all things, except their Wives, in common; and their custome
in eating is, that every man in his turn feasts all the
rest; and he that makes the entertainment, is seated betwixt
the two Kings; where having highly commended his own
chear, they carve and distribute it amongst the guests.</p>

<p>At my arrival here, I met four stranger-Indians, whose
Bodies were painted in various colours with figures of Animals
whose likeness I had never seen: and by some discourse
and signes which passed between us, I gathered that
they were the only survivours of fifty, who set out together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
in company from some great Island, as I conjecture, to the
Northwest; for I understood that they crossed a great Water,
in which most of their party perished by tempest, the
rest dying in the Marishes and Mountains by famine and
hard weather, after a two-months travel by Land and Water
in quest of this Island of <i>Akenatzy</i>.</p>

<p>The most reasonable conjecture that I can frame out of
this Relation, is, that these Indians might come from the
Island of new <i>Albion</i> or <i>California</i>, from whence we may
imagine some great arm of the Indian Ocean or Bay stretches
into the Continent towards the <i>Apalatæan</i> Mountains in the
nature of a mid-land Sea, in which many of these Indians
might have perished. To confirm my opinion in this point,
I have heard several Indians testifie, that the Nation of <i>Rickohockans</i>,
who dwell not far to the Westward of the <i>Apalatæan</i>
Mountains, are seated upon a Land, as they term it, of
great Waves; by which I suppose they mean the Sea-shore.</p>

<p>The next day after my arrival at <i>Akenatzy</i>, a <i>Rickohockan</i>
Ambassadour, attended by five Indians, whose faces were coloured
with <i>Auripigmentum</i> (in which Mineral these parts
do much abound) was received, and that night invited
to a Ball of their fashion; but in the height of their mirth
and dancing, by a smoke contrived for that purpose, the
Room was suddenly darkned, and for what cause I know
not, the <i>Rickohockan</i> and his Retinue barbarously murthered.
This struck me with such an affrightment, that the very
next day, without taking my leave of them, I slunk away
with my Indian Companion. Though the desire of informing
my self further concerning some Minerals, as <i>Auripigmentum,
&amp;c.</i> which I there took special notice of, would
have perswaded me to stay longer amongst them, had not
the bloody example of their treachery to the <i>Rickohockans</i>
frighted me away.</p>

<p>The fourteenth of <i>June</i>, pursuing a South-southwest course,
sometimes by a beaten path, and sometimes over hills and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
rocks, I was forc’d to take up my quarters in the Woods:
for though the <i>Oenock</i>-Indians, whom I then sought, were
not in a direct line above thirty odde miles distant from <i>Akenatzy</i>,
yet the Ways were such, and obliged me to go so
far about, that I reached not <i>Oenock</i> until the sixteenth.
The Country here, by the industry of these Indians, is very
open, and clear of wood. Their Town is built round a
field, where in their Sports they exercise with so much labour
and violence, and in so great numbers, that I have seen
the ground wet with the sweat that dropped from their bodies:
their chief Recreation is Slinging of stones. They
are of mean stature and courage, covetous and thievish, industrious
to earn a peny; and therefore hire themselves out
to their neighbours, who employ them as Carryers or Porters.
They plant abundance of Grain, reap three Crops in
a Summer, and out of their Granary supply all the adjacent
parts. These and the Mountain-Indians build not
their houses of Bark, but of Watling and Plaister. In Summer,
the heat of the weather makes them chuse to lie abroad
in the night under thin arbours of wilde Palm. Some houses
they have of Reed and Bark; they build them generally
round: to each house belongs a little hovel made like an
oven, where they lay up their Corn and Mast, and keep it
dry. They parch their Nuts and Acorns over the fire, to
take away their rank Oyliness; which afterwards pressed,
yeeld a milky liquor, and the Acorns an Amber-colour’d
Oyl. In these, mingled together, they dip their Cakes at
great Entertainments, and so serve them up to their guests
as an extraordinary dainty. Their Government is Democratick;
and the Sentences of their old men are received as
Laws, or rather Oracles, by them.</p>

<p>Fourteen miles West-Southwest of the <i>Oenocks</i>, dwell the
<i>Shackory</i>-Indians, upon a rich Soyl, and yet abounding in
Antimony, of which they shewed me considerable quantities.
Finding them agree with the <i>Oenocks</i> in Customs and
Manners, I made no stay here, but passing thorow their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Town, I travelled till the nineteenth of <i>June</i>; and then
after a two days troublesome Journey thorow Thickets and
Marish grounds, I arrived at <i>Watary</i> above fourty miles
distant, and bearing West-Southwest to <i>Shakor</i>. This Nation
differs in Government from all the other Indians of these
parts: for they are Slaves, rather then Subjects to their King.
Their present Monarch is a grave man, and courteous to
strangers: yet I could not without horrour behold his barbarous
Superstition, in hiring three youths, and sending
them forth to kill as many young women of their Enemies
as they could light on, to serve his son, then newly dead, in
the other world, as he vainly fancyed. These youths during
my stay returned with skins torn off the heads and faces of
three young girls, which they presented to his Majestie, and
were by him gratefully received.</p>

<p>I departed from <i>Watary</i> the one and twentieth of <i>June</i>,
and keeping a West-course for near thirty miles, I came to
<i>Sara</i>: here I found the ways more level and easie. <i>Sara</i> is
not far distant from the Mountains, which here lose their
height, and change their course and name: for they run
due West, and receive from the Spaniards the name of
<i>Suala</i>. From these Mountains or Hills the Indians draw
great quantities of <i>Cinabar</i>, with which beaten to powder
they colour their faces: this Mineral is of a deeper Purple
then <i>Vermilion</i>, and is the same which is in so much esteem
amongst Physitians, being the first element of Quicksilver.</p>

<p>I did likewise, to my no small admiration, find hard cakes
of white Salt amongst them; but whether they were made
of Sea-water, or taken out of Salt-pits, I know not: but
am apt to believe the later, because the Sea is so remote from
them. Many other rich Commodities and Minerals there
are undoubtedly in these parts, which if possessed by an ingenious
and industrious people, would be improved to vast
advantages by Trade. But having tied my self up to things
onely that I have seen in my Travels, I will deliver no
Conjectures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p><i>Lingua sile non est ultra narrabile quidquam.</i></p>

<p>These Indians are so indiscreetly fond of their children,
that they will not chastise them for any mischief or insolence.
A little Boy had shot an Arrow thorow my body,
had I not reconciled him to me with gifts: and all this anger
was, because I spurred my horse out of another Arrows
way which he directed at him. This caused fetch a mutiny
amongst the Youth of the Town, that the Seniors taking my
horse and self into protection, had much ado (and that by
intreaties and prayers, not commands) to appease them.</p>

<p>From <i>Sara</i> I kept a South-Southwest course until the five
and twentieth of <i>June</i>, and then I reached <i>Wisacky</i>. This
three-days march was more troublesome to me then all my
travels besides: for the direct way which I took from <i>Sara</i>
to <i>Wisacky</i> is over a continued Marish over-grown with
Reeds, from whose roots sprung knotty stumps as hard and
sharp as Flint. I was forc’d to lead my horse most part of
the way, and wonder that he was not either plunged in the
Bogs, or lamed by those rugged knots.</p>

<p>This Nation is subject to a neighbour-King residing upon
the bank of a great Lake called <i>Ushery</i>, invironed of all
sides with Mountains, and <i>Wisacky</i> Marish; and therefore
I will detain the Reader no longer with the discourse of
them, because I comprehend them in that of <i>Ushery</i>.</p>

<p>The six and, twentieth of <i>June</i>, having crossed a fresh
River which runs into the Lake of <i>Ushery</i>, I came to the
Town, which was more populous then any I had seen before
in my March. The King dwells some three miles
from it, and therefore I had no opportunity of seeing him
the two nights which I stayed there. This Prince, though
his Dominions are large and populous, is in continual fear
of the <i>Oustack</i>-Indians seated on the opposite side of the
Lake; a people so addicted to Arms, that even their women
come into the field, and shoot Arrows over their husbands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
shoulders, who shield them with Leathern Targets.
The men it seems should fight with Silver-Hatchets: for
one of the <i>Usheryes</i> told me they were of the same metal
with the Pomel of my Sword. They are a cruel generation,
and prey upon people, whom they either steal, or force
away from the <i>Usheryes</i> in <i>Periago’s</i>, to sacrifice to their
Idols. The <i>Ushery</i>-women delight much in feather-ornaments,
of which they have great variety; but Peacocks in
most esteem, because rare in those parts. They are reasonably
handsome, and have more of civility in their carriage
then I observed in the other Nations with whom I conversed;
which is the reason that the men are more effeminate
and lazie.</p>

<p>These miserable wretches are strangely infatuated with illusions
of the devil: it caused no small horrour in me, to
see one of them wrythe his neck all on one side, foam at the
mouth, stand bare-foot upon burning coals for near an hour,
and then recovering his senses, leap out of the fire without
hurt, or signe of any. This I was an eye-witness of.</p>

<p>The water of <i>Ushery</i>-lake seemed to my taste a little
brackish; which I rather impute to some Mineral-waters
which flow into it, then to any saltness it can take from the
Sea, which we may reasonably suppose is a great way from
it. Many pleasant Rivulets fall into it, and it is stored with
great plenty of excellent fish. I judged it to be about ten
leagues broad: for were not the other shore very high, it
could not be discerned from <i>Ushery</i>. How far this Lake
tends Westerly, or where it ends, I could neither learn or
guess.</p>

<p>Here I made a days stay, to inform my self further in
these Countries; and understood both from the <i>Usheries</i>,
and some <i>Sara</i>-Indians that came to trade with them, that
two-days journey and a half from hence to the Southwest,
a powerful Nation of Bearded men were seated, which I
suppose to be the Spaniards, because the Indians never have
any; it being an universal custom amongst them, to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
their growth, by plucking the young hair out by the roots.
Westward lies a Government inhospitable to strangers; and
to the North, over the <i>Suala</i>-mountains, lay the <i>Rickohockans</i>.
I thought it not safe to venture my self amongst the
Spaniards, lest taking me for a Spy, they would either make
me away, or condemn me to a perpetual Slavery in their
Mines. Therefore not thinking fit to proceed further,
the eight and twentieth of <i>June</i> I faced about, and looked
homewards.</p>

<p>To avoid <i>Wisacky</i>-Marish, I shaped my course Northeast;
and after three days travel over hilly ways, where I met
with no path or road, I fell into a barren Sandy desert,
where I suffered miserably for want of water; the heat of
the Summer having drunk all the Springs dry, and left no
signe of any, but the Gravelly chanels in which they run:
so that if now and then I had not found a standing Pool,
which provident Nature set round with shady Oaks, to defend
it from the ardour of the Sun, my Indian companion,
horse and self had certainly perished with thirst. In this
distress we travelled till the twelfth of <i>July</i>, and then found
the head of a River, which afterwards proved <i>Eruco</i>; in
which we received not onely the comfort of a necessary and
seasonable refreshment, but likewise the hopes of coming
into a Country again where we might finde Game for food
at least, if not discover some new Nation or People. Nor
did our hopes fail us: for after we had crossed the River
twice, we were led by it upon the fourteenth of <i>July</i> to the
Town of <i>Katearas</i>, a place of great Indian Trade and Commerce,
and chief Seat of the haughty Emperour of the
<i>Toskiroro’s</i>, called <i>Kaskusara</i>, vulgarly <i>Kaskous</i>. His grim
Majestie, upon my first appearance, demanded my Gun and
Shot; which I willingly parted with, to ransom my self
out of his clutches: for he was the most proud imperious
Barbarian that I met with in all my Marches. The people
here at this time seemed prepared for some extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Solemnity: for the men and the women of better sort had
decked themselves very fine with pieces of bright Copper in
their hair and ears, and about their arms and neck, which
upon Festival occasions they use as an extraordinary bravery:
by which it should seem this Country is not without
rich Mines of Copper. But I durst not stay to inform my
self further in it, being jealous of some sudden mischief towards
me from <i>Kaskous</i>, his nature being bloudy, and provoked
upon any slight occasion.</p>

<p>Therefore leaving <i>Katearas</i>, I travelled through the
Woods until the sixteenth, upon which I came to <i>Kawitziokan</i>,
an Indian town upon a branch of <i>Rorenoke</i>-river,
which here I passed over, continuing my journey to
Menchœrinck; and on the seventeenth departing from
thence, I lay all night in the Woods, and the next morning
betimes going by <i>Natoway</i>, I reached that evening <i>Apamatuck</i>
in <i>Virginia</i>, where I was not a little overjoyed to see
Christian faces again.</p>

or Spurs of the <i>Apalatæan</i>-mountains.</p>

<p>These <i>Savanæ</i> are low grounds at the foot of the <i>Apalatæans</i>,
which all the Winter, Spring, and part of the
Summer, lie under snow or water, when the snow is dissolved,
which falls down from the Mountains commonly about
the beginning of <i>June</i>; and then their verdure is
wonderful pleasant to the eye, especially of such as having
travelled through the shade of the vast Forest, come out of
a melancholy darkness of a sudden, into a clear and open
skie. To heighten the beauty of these parts, the first
Springs of most of those great Rivers which run into the
<i>Atlantick</i> Ocean, or <i>Cheseapeack</i> Bay, do here break out, and
in various branches interlace the flowry Meads, whose luxurious
herbage invites numerous herds of Red Deer (for their
unusual largeness improperly termed Elks by ignorant people)
to feed. The right Elk, though very common in <i>New
Scotland</i>, <i>Canada</i>, and those Northern parts, is never seen on
this side of the Continent: for that which the <i>Virginians</i>
call Elk’s, does not at all differ from the Red Deer of <i>Europe</i>,
but in his dimensions, which are far greater: but yet
the Elk in bigness does as far exceed them: their heads, or
horns, are not very different; but the neck of the Elk is so
short, that it hardly separates the head from the shoulders;
which is the reason that they cannot feed upon level ground
but by falling on their knees, though their heads be a yard-long:
therefore they commonly either brouse upon trees, or
standing up to the belly in ponds or rivers feed upon the
banks: their Cingles or tails are hardly three inches long,
I have been told by a <i>New-England</i>-Gentleman, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
lips and nostrils of this creature is the most delicious meat he
ever tasted. As for the Red Deer we here treat of, I cannot
difference the taste of their flesh from those in <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p>The six and twentieth of <i>August</i> we came to the Mountains,
where finding no horse-way up, we alighted, and left
our horses with two or three Indians below, whilst we went
up afoot. The ascent was so steep, the cold so intense, and
we so tired, that having with much ado gained the top of
one of the highest, we drank the Kings Health in Brandy,
gave the Mountain His name, and agreed to return back
again, having no encouragement from that prospect to proceed
to a further discovery; since from hence we saw another
Mountain, bearing North and by West to us, of a prodigious
height: for according to an observation of the distance
taken by Col. <i>Catlet</i>, it could not be less then fifty
leagues from the place we stood upon.</p>

<p>Here was I stung in my sleep by a Mountain-spider; and
had not an Indian suckt out the poyson, I had died: for receiving
the hurt at the tip of one of my fingers, the venome
shot up immediately into my shoulder, and so inflamed my
side, that it is not possible to express my torment. The
means used by my Physician, was first a small dose of Snakeroot-powder,
which I took in a little water; and then making
a kinde of Plaister of the same, applied it neer to the
part affected: when he had done so, he swallowed some by
way of Antidote himself, and suckt my fingers end so violently,
that I felt the venome retire back from my side into
my shoulder, and from thence down my arm: having thus
sucked half a score times, and spit as often, I was eased of
all my pain, and perfectly recovered. I thought I had been
bit by a Rattle-snake, for I saw not what hurt me: but the
Indian found by the wound, and the effects of it, that it
was given by a Spider, one of which he shewed me the next
day: it is not unlike our great blue Spider, onely it is somewhat
longer. I suppose the nature of his poyson to be much
like that of the <i>Tarantula</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>I being thus beyond my hopes and expectation restored
to my self, we unanimously agreed to return back, seeing
no possibility of passing through the Mountains: and finding
our Indians with our horses in the place where we left
them, we rode homewards without making any further
Discovery.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap gesperrt">Conjectures</span> of the Land beyond
the <i>Apalatæan</i> Mountains.</h2>

</div>

<p>They are certainly in a great errour, who imagine that
the Continent of North-<i>America</i> is but eight or ten
days journey over from the <i>Atlantick</i> to the <i>Indian</i> Ocean:
which all reasonable men must acknowledge, if they consider
that Sir <i>France Drake</i> kept a West-Northwest course
from <i>Cape Mendocino</i> to <i>California</i>. Nevertheless, by what
I gathered from the stranger Indians at <i>Akenatzy</i> of their
Voyage by Sea to the very Mountains from a far distant
Northwest Country, I am brought over to their opinion
who think that the Indian Ocean does stretch an Arm or
Bay from <i>California</i> into the Continent as far as the <i>Apalatæan</i>
Mountains, answerable to the Gulfs of <i>Florida</i> and
<i>Mexico</i> on this side. Yet I am far from believing with some,
that such great and Navigable Rivers are to be found on
the other side the <i>Apalatæans</i> falling into the Indian Ocean,
as those which run from them to the Eastward. My first
reason is derived from the knowledge and experience we
already have of South-<i>America</i>, whose <i>Andes</i> send the
greatest Rivers in the world (as the <i>Amazones</i> and <i>Rio de
la Plata</i> &amp;c.) into the <i>Atlantick</i>, but none at all into the
<i>Pacifique</i> Sea. Another Argument is, that all our Water-fowl
which delight in Lakes and Rivers, as Swans, Geese,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Ducks, <i>&amp;c.</i> come over the Mountains from the Lake of
<i>Canada</i>, when it is frozen over every Winter, to our fresh
Rivers; which they would never do, could they finde any
on the other side of the <i>Apalatæans</i>.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap gesperrt">Instructions</span> to such as shall
march upon Discoveries into the
North-<i>American</i> Continent.</h2>

</div>

<p>Two breaches there are in the <i>Apalatæan</i> Mountains, opening
a passage into the Western parts of the Continent.
One, as I am informed by Indians, at a place called
<i>Zynodoa</i>, to the Norward; the other at <i>Sara</i>, where I have
been my self: but the way thither being thorow a vast Forest,
where you seldom fall into any Road or Path, you must
shape your course by a Compass; though some, for want of
one, have taken their direction from the North-side of the
trees, which is distinguished from the rest by quantities of
thick Moss growing there. You will not meet with many
hinderances on horseback in your passage to the Mountains,
but where your course is interrupted by branches of the
great Rivers, which in many places are not Fordable; and
therefore if you be unprovided of means or strength to
make a Bridge by felling trees across, you may be forced to
go a great way about: in this respect company is necessary,
but in others so inconvenient, that I would not advise above
half a dozen, or ten at the most, to travel together;
and of these, the major part Indians: for the Nations in
your way are prone to jealousie and mischief towards Christians
in a considerable Body, and as courteous and hearty
to a few, from whom they apprehend no danger.</p>

<p>When you pass thorow an even level Country, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
you can take no particular remarks from hill or waters to
guide your self by when you come back, you must not
forget to notch the trees as you go along with your small
Hatchet, that in your return you may know when you
fall into the same way which you went. By this means you
will be certain of the place you are in, and may govern your
course homeward accordingly.</p>

<p>In stead of Bread, I used the meal of parched <i>Mayz</i>, i. e.
Indian Wheat; which when I eat, I seasoned with a little
Salt. This is both more portable and strengthning then Biscuit,
and will suffer no mouldiness by any weather. For
other provisions, you may securely trust to your Gun, the
Woods being full of Fallow, and <i>Savanæ</i> of Red-Deer, besides
great variety of excellent Fowl, as wilde Turkeys, Pigeons,
Partridges, Phesants, <i>&amp;c.</i> But you must not forget
to dry or barbecue some of these before you come to the
Mountains: for upon them you will meet with no Game,
except a few Bears.</p>

<p>Such as cannot lie on the ground, must be provided with
light Hamacks, which hung in the trees, are more cool and
pleasant then any bed whatsoever.</p>

<p>The Order and Discipline to be observed in this Expedition
is, that an Indian Scout or two march as far before the
rest of the company as they can in sight, both for the finding
out provision, and discovery of Ambushes, if any should
be laid by Enemies. Let your other Indians keep on the
right and left hand, armed not onely with Guns, but Bills
and Hatchets, to build small Arbours or Cottages of boughs
and bark of trees, to shelter and defend you from the injuries
of the weather. At nights it is necessary to make
great Fires round about the place where you take up your
lodging, as well to scare Wild-beasts away, as to purifie the
air. Neither must you fail to go the Round at the close of
the evening: for then, and betimes in the morning, the Indians
put all their designes in execution: in the night they
never attempt any thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>When in the remote parts you draw near to an Indian
Town, you must by your Scouts inform your self whether
they hold any correspondence with the <i>Sasquesahanaughs</i>;
for to such you must give notice of your approach by a Gun;
which amongst other Indians is to be avoided, because being
ignorant of their use, it would affright and dispose them
to some treacherous practice against you.</p>

<p>Being arrived at a Town, enter no house until you are invited;
and then seem not afraid to be led in pinion’d like a
prisoner: for that is a Ceremony they use to friends and enemies
without distinction.</p>

<p>You must accept of an invitation from the Seniors, before
that of young men; and refuse nothing that is offered
or set afore you: for they are very jealous, and sensible of
the least slighting or neglect from strangers, and mindful of
Revenge.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">Touching <span class="smcap gesperrt">Trade</span> with Indians.</h2>

</div>

<p>If you barely designe a Home-trade with neighbour-Indians,
for skins of Deer, Beaver, Otter, Wild-Cat, Fox,
Racoon, &amp;c. your best Truck is a sort of course Trading
Cloth, of which a yard and a half makes a Matchcoat or
Mantle fit for their wear; as also Axes, Hoes, Knives, Sizars,
and all sorts of edg’d tools. Guns, Powder and
Shot, <i>&amp;c.</i> are Commodities they will greedily barter for:
but to supply the Indians with Arms and Ammunition,
is prohibited in all English Governments.</p>

<p>In dealing with the Indians, you must be positive and at a
word: for if they perswade you to fall any thing in your
price, they will spend time in higgling for further abatements,
and seldom conclude any Bargain. Sometimes you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
may with Brandy or Strong liquor dispose them to an humour
of giving you ten times the value of your commodity;
and at other times they are so hide-bound, that they
will not offer half the Market-price, especially if they be aware
that you have a designe to circumvent them with drink,
or that they think you have a desire to their goods; which
you must seem to slight and disparage.</p>

<p>To the remoter Indians you must carry other kinde of
Truck, as small Looking-glasses, Pictures, Beads and Bracelets
of glass, Knives, Sizars, and all manner of gaudy toys
and knacks for children, which are light and portable. For
they are apt to admire such trinkets, and will purchase them
at any rate, either with their currant Coyn of small shells,
which they call <i>Roanoack</i> or <i>Peack</i>, or perhaps with Pearl,
Vermilion, pieces of Christal; and towards <i>Ushery</i>, with
some odde pieces of Plate or Buillon, which they sometimes
receive in Truck from the <i>Oestacks</i>.</p>

<p>Could I have foreseen when I set out, the advantages to
be made by a Trade with those remote Indians, I had gone
better provided; though perhaps I might have run a great
hazard of my life, had I purchased considerably amongst
them, by carrying wealth unguarded through so many different
Nations of barbarous people: therefore it is vain for
any man to propose to himself, or undertake a Trade at that
distance, unless he goes with strength to defend, as well as
an Adventure to purchase such Commodities: for in such a
designe many ought to joyn and go in company.</p>

<p>Some pieces of Silver unwrought I purchased my self of
the <i>Usheries</i>, for no other end then to justifie this account I
give of my Second Expedition, which had not determined
at <i>Ushery</i>, were I accompanied with half a score resolute
youths that would have stuck to me in a further discovery
towards the Spanish Mines.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
